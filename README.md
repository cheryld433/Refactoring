# Refactoring

This project is a lesson in code refactoring for the provided HTML and CSS files. It was an exercise in improving the efficiency and cleaning up the existing code without changing the external behavior of the website. Refactoring improves the readability and reduces the complexity of the code. With the addition of meta tags, type, nav, section, header, footer, and alt attributes I was able to improve accessibility. By reducingthe paragraphs to 80 characters a line I was able to clean up the HTML file and make it a little easier to maintain or edit the file. By creating shortcuts and moving the content selector to a more relevant place I was able to enhance the state of the CSS code. By creating a id element for a link that opened in the same page I was able render the website completely accessible to uses with disabilities. My project is able to show my ability to enhance the syntax and layout of the website, I became more familiar with individual elements and selectors as well as the rules that apply to each.
