# Refactoring

This project is a lesson in code refactoring. I wanted to do this project because I wanted to gain better insight into the syntax of both HTML and CSS, in the  process I also gained a better understanding of efficiency, readability, accessibility.

In HTML:
•	Added <meta name=""> tag for more accessibility on different devices.
•	Replaced <div> elements with more current elements relating to the layout and design, including <section>, <nav>, and <article>.
•	Added an alt attribute to all <img> to increase readability.
•	Reduced the number of characters per line.

In CSS:
•	Combined similar class selectors to reduce complexity and repetition.
•	Moved selectors up the cascade to better flow with the index.html
